[0.97a-RC11] Delta Cores v1.0 - Last changed in 2024.06.16

Adds delta AI cores that contribute a 0x multiplier to the automated ship penalty.

[Changes - v1.0] JBOD - Just a Bunch o' Deltas!

- Add "Delta Core" to the list of AI cores.

- These cores can be found in any location where regular cores can be found (probes, stations, etc).

- They have 0 skill, but contribute a 0x multiplier to the automated ship penalty!

- Not illegal by most factions since they are so stupid. However, the church and path will consider these as luxury goods and will confiscate them.

- Faction representitives won't pay you for these since they are not sentient (a.k.a dumb).
