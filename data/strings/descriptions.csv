delta_core,RESOURCE,"A cluster of delta-level AI cores, capable of supporting the most basic of tasks, incapable of changing its directives and only used in limited, highly specialized roles. Assigning a delta to aid human overseers in administering a colony-wide industry brings absolutely no benefits.

These low level AI cores are completely legal by most factions. Faction representatives will not be willing to exchange these for any amounts of cash.

A common and cheap AI core, the delta-level is not considered to be truley intellegent under Domain-era AI protocols. A delta core is more akin to an animal's neural patterns, capable of autonomously designating threats and not much more.",,,,
